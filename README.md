## Reproduction 

- [data](https://github.com/alexeykosh/Frequency-and-character-complexity-in-27-writing-systems/tree/main/data) contains the dataset with 1560 characters from 27 writing systems used in this analysis.

- [preprocessing](https://github.com/alexeykosh/Frequency-and-character-complexity-in-27-writing-systems/tree/main/preprocessing) contains files needed to build the final dataset. 

- [analysis.R](https://github.com/alexeykosh/Frequency-and-character-complexity-in-27-writing-systems/blob/main/analysis.R) contains the code needed to reproduce all of the analyses and figures used in the paper. To run the code, you would need to install all of the packages listed in the beginning of the file (usually it is done autrimatically by R-Studio). This code is successfully executed in R-Studio 2022.02.0 with R version 4.2.0.
